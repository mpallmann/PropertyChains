		<h1>The Elementals</h1>

		<h2 id="Chapter1">Chapter 1</h2>
		<p><span class="FirstLetter">I</span>t was Duncan who saw it. At first, no one believed him, but 
		his oldest sister, Elizabeth humored him and went outside to see 
		the "broken lights", his name for fireworks. As they opened the 
		back door, the smoke trail was still visible. It looked like it 
		might have landed in the lake.</p>
		
		<p>"It looks like he's right! I think it hit the lake," Elizabeth 
		called back through the open door.</p>
		
		<p>The family came running to see the slowly dissipating smoke. 
		Mom had been in the kitchen and got there first, closely followed 
		by Ian, who was always curious to see what was going on. After a 
		minute, Dad appeared and looked out quietly, as was his nature.</p>
		
		<p>"Well, let's get back inside, before dinner burns," said Mom. 
		She left Dad to shoo the kids back in, which took some doing. Ian 
		was the last to leave, his sister's words ringing in his ears, 
		"it hit the lake."</p>
		
		<p>During dinner, they talked about what Duncan has seen. He was 
		4 years old and could never keep still. He kept repeating that the 
		"broken lights fall down". Repeated attempts yielded little more 
		information. Torrin was the only one who hadn't come to the door, 
		being occupied with his drawing, and had to be told what occurred.</p>
		
		<p>That night each family member had their own ideas about what 
		happened. Mom and Dad thought it was probably an aircraft accident. 
		Elizabeth thought it was aliens. Torrin wondered if it was a blimp, 
		because they didn’t hear any noise. Duncan still went on about "broken 
		lights".</p>
		
		<p>But Ian couldn't guess what it was. And he wanted to know. He could 
		see his parents weren't going to go find it, so he would have to do 
		it himself. He was 6 years old and very determined. He also know he 
		would have to wait until everyone was asleep. It was hard staying 
		awake, but he managed to do it.</p>
		
		<p>Then he quietly slid the window open-the one without a screen-and 
		hopped out. He could just reach the window to lower most of the way 
		again. He realized that he should have gotten a flashlight, but 
		fortunately there was a security light behind the house which lit 
		the backyard. He quietly walked to the back fence and climbed over 
		it. He walked quietly behind the neighbor's house to the back road.</p>
		
		<p>He had to be careful that a car didn’t see him, because they would 
		wonder why a small boy was out in the middle of the night. The lake 
		was just down the road, about half a mile. He was feeling a little 
		tired when he got there, and sat down at the water's edge.</p>
		
		<p>It was quiet and dark. He felt a little disappointed-he had hoped 
		to see something of what happened. There was no smoke, no fire, not 
		even wreckage. Maybe they had hauled it away already. He got up to 
		leave, when something caught his eye.</p>
		
		<p>It was a box glistening in to moonlight. He picked it up and 
		started home before he got in trouble.</p>

		<h2 id="Chapter2">Chapter 2</h2>

		<p><span class="FirstLetter">T</span>here are beings in the universe 
		far stranger than humans have 
		experienced. There are the gasbags of Delta VII, which fill up with 
		gas as they mature to float amongst the clouds. Or consider the Trlic 
		from Vega Prime-a hive mind with thousands of worker drones obeying 
		its commands. But humans still have not concrete proof of 
		extraterrestrial, sentient life.</p>
		
		<p>For all their searching of the heavens, humans still have yet to 
		attract anyone’s attention. But there are several species who keep 
		an eye on them, waiting for the day they will be worth contacting. 
		One of these species is called Billups.</p>
		
		<p>Billups are short, yellow, and have a single eyestalk on the top 
		of their heads. They like to dress in muted colors so that they can 
		show off their yellow color. This coloration is important to their 
		social structure. It shows how healthy your spirit is. It is said 
		that the Mystic Circle, the ruling body, glow because they are so 
		spiritual.</p>
		
		<p>They consider themselves guardians of the stars they control. They 
		protect the inhabitants, including the clueless ones, from the likes 
		of the Great Reapers and CRABs. These species want to continually 
		expand their empires and take advantage of less powerful species.</p>
		
		<p>The Billups took great care not contacting the people of earth, 
		mostly because there was little they could offer them. It seems 
		likely to cause more problems than leaving them alone. So they sent 
		patrols every so often to make sure everything was peaceful.</p>
		
		<p>Ha'dupe was one of the pilots who patrolled the earth sector 
		Sector 017.002.108). He liked it, because it was quiet. Not like his 
		last assignment on the CRABs border. There were a lot of other 
		peaceful places, but he liked to look in on the earthers.</p>
		
		<p>Suddenly there was a jerk. An explosion outside the cockpit forced 
		his ship careening toward the planet. It was his starboard engine, now 
		a fireball behind him. He checked his wing, it might hold together 
		enough to land. It had to—he was already entering the upper atmosphere. 
		The friction was already causing a heat blind, making it impossible to 
		see. He tried to reverse his one engine left to slow his speed. His 
		craft slowly began responding again.</p>
		
		<p>Finally in control again, he looked for a place to land. Protocol 
		stated he should find a body of water, to assist in avoiding detection. 
		These people, for all their professions of the existence of aliens, 
		were terrified of the prospect. He was already low to the ground and 
		saw a lake just ahead. It was small, but should do to land in.</p>
		
		<p>He pushed the engines to full reverse and slid smoothly into the 
		water. Steam hissed as it contacted his superheated hull. His craft 
		came to rest on the bottom of the lake. He performed his post-flight 
		checks and pulled out his underwater gear. It would take him some 
		time to complete the repairs. As he suited up he wondered why his 
		engine has exploded.</p>
